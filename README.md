# mws-clj

My initial experiments using Clojure to access Amazon's [merchant web services API](https://developer.amazonservices.com ). Although it was promising, for various reasons we ended up using a private (sorry) fork of [czpython/python-amazon-mws](https://github.com/czpython/python-amazon-mws).

## Status

The code dates back to 2013 and in its current form runs only in the REPL with hard-coded keys, merchant ids, etc., but it might be a useful starting point.
